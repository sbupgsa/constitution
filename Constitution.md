Disciplinary action is a three-step process, enumerated in the following subsections.

The individual in question shall be notified formally by some verbal communication, which directly addresses the concerns of the Board of Directors and any related members.
Following the warning, said individual may be placed on a probationary period determined by the Board of Directors for no less than 1 month and no longer than 6 months.
The individual must be notified regarding their probationary status and be clearly informed as to the length of the period.
Should the disruptive behavior continue without regard for the warning, the Board of Directors may seek mediation, so long as the probationary period has not expired.
A member may be placed on probation a maximum of two times before proceeding to the mediation step.
Providing a warning to a member or placing a member on probation requires the support of a simple majority of the Board of Directors.
Once this course of action is decided, the Advisor shall be informed.
If any further infractions occur during the probationary period, then the Board of Directors will immediately move to mediation.
Probation can entail, but is not limited to: a simple, formal warning and review period, barring the member from participating in activities of the organization for a designated period of time, or revocation of the member&rsquo;s right to use shared spaces.

#### SUBSECTION B: MEDIATION

If it becomes clear that the warning given to a disruptive individual has been ignored or was not effective, the Board of Directors may choose to seek mediation from a neutral outside party.
The individual in question shall be notified in writing of the decision and may participate in the selection of the neutral party as well as in scheduling the meeting.
The individual must be given a chance to defend their actions.
Moving to mediation requires a unanimous vote of the Board of Directors and must be followed immediately by informing the Advisor of the pending mediation.
All voting members of Board of Directors members must be present at the meeting.

#### SUBSECTION C: REMOVAL

The Board of Directors may remove a member if and only if there is clear, presentable evidence or testimony from other members of the organization that the individual in question has not corrected or otherwise properly addressed their disruptive behavior after both a warning and mediation.
At this point the Board of Directors may vote upon the removal of the individual from the organization.
Removing a member requires the Board of Directors to vote unanimously in favor of the motion and written consent from the Advisor, who will be notified prior to the vote.
The individual must be notified in person of the Board of Directors&rsquo; decision, with at least one neutral party present, and shall be provided a written transcript of the meeting following the proceedings.
Revocation of membership entails no longer being allowed to participate in or be present at activities of the organization, vote, and no longer being able to represent the organization either formally or informally.

### Section 2: Board Members

Members&mdash;whether voting or non-voting&mdash;of the Board of Directors may be removed from office for cause as provided in the parliamentary authority.

The organization seeks to maintain close relations to the Department.
As such, the position of faculty Advisor shall remain with the chair of the Quality of Life Committee of the Department unless otherwise specified by the Board of Directors.

### Section 2: Consideration

At the final general body meeting of the academic year, all proposed amendments must be brought forth by members of the general body and will be discussed.
Given the nature of the agenda of such a meeting, all members shall be notified of this meeting at least one business week prior to its scheduled date.

In order to move forward, at least two-thirds of the general membership body must agree that the amendment is a worthy addition to the Constitution.

At the final meeting of the Board of Directors, all amendments receiving two-thirds support of the general body shall be discussed further and modified into their final forms.
