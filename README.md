The *Constitution* of the Physics Graduate Student Association at Stony Brook University, last amended April 5, 2017 and last ratified &ldquo;XX/XX/2017&rdquo;.

**Editors notes:**

At the time of writing (of this README file, not of the *Constitution* itself), the link to the &ldquo;latest edition&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Student Club and Organization Handbook&rdquo; in Article VI, Section 1 of the *Constitution* is a dead link.

Article VI, Section 4, Subsection C of the *Constitution* contains a formula that has been altered for representation with Markdown.
